### Vault Password

The password will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10 characters, it contains at least one digit, as well as at least one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter. The password may only contain ASCII latin letters or digits, no punctuation symbols.

You are given a password. We need your code to verify if it meets the conditions for a secure password.

In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible. The shorter your code, the more points you earn. Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.

**Input:** A password as a string.

**Output:** A determination if the password safe or not as a boolean, or any data type that can be converted and processed as a boolean. When the results process, you will see the converted results.

**Example:**
````
golf('A1213pokl') == False
golf('bAse730onE') == True
golf('asasasasasasasaas') == False
golf('QWERTYqwerty') == False
golf('123456123456') == False
golf('QwErTy911poqqqq') == True
````
**Precondition:**

0 < "password| â‰¤ 64

password matches by regexp expression `"[a-zA-Z0-9]+"`

**Scoring:**

Scoring in this mission is based on the number of characters used in your code (comment lines are not counted).

*Rank1:*

Any code length.

*Rank2:*

Your code should be shorter than 200 characters.

*Rank3:*

Your code should be shorter than 100 characters.

**How it is used:**

If you are worried about the security of your app or service, you can use this handy code to personally check your users' passwords for complexity. You can further use these skills to require that your users passwords meet or include even more conditions, punctuation or unicode.

### Verify Anagrams

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Two words are anagrams to each other if we can get one from another by rearranging the letters. Anagrams are case-insensitive and don't take whitespaces into account.

For example: "Gram Ring Mop" and "Programming" are anagrams. But "Hello" and "Ole Oh" are not.

You are given two words or phrases. Try to verify if they are anagrams.

**Input:** Two arguments. Words as strings.

**Output:** Determination if the passwords are anagrams or not as boolean (True or False).

**Example:**
````
verify_anagrams("Programming", "Gram Ring Mop") == True
verify_anagrams("Hello", "Ole Oh") == False
verify_anagrams("Kyoto", "Tokyo") == True
````
**Precondition:**
````
0 < |first_word| < 100

0 < |second_word| < 100
````
Words contain only ASCII latin letters and whitespaces.

**How it is used:**

Anagramming can be a fun way to train your brain, but they have other applications. Psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called "anagram solution tasks", to assess the implicit memory. Anagrams are often used to create pseudonyms, allowing one to conceal, reveal or operate somewhere in between - like a mask that can establish identity. In addition to this, multiple anagramming is a technique sometimes used to solve some kinds of cryptograms.
