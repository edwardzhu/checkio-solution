###Max of Two

Define a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

**Input:** Two arguments as numbers.

**Output:** Maximum of two.

**Example:**

my_max(3, 3) == 3
my_max(0, 1) == 1
my_max(3, 2) == 3
--------------------------------------
###String Length

Define a function that computes the length of a given string.

**Input:** String.

**Output:** It's length.

**Example:**

str_length("") == 0
str_length("mo") == 2
str_length("length") == 6
---------------------------------------
###Rotate List

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list.

**Input:** Two arguments. List of elements and positive integer

**Output:** Converter list of elements

**Example:**

rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) === [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]
rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3) === [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

###Fizz Buzz

To get them ready for storage, we need the worker-bots to sort crystals by 3 or 5 or divide them by the number of edges. To make things easier, we will base our program on the ancient human word game "Fizz buzz".

Our goal is to write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:

The phrase **"Fizz Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5,

The word **"Fizz"** if the number is divisible by 3,

The word **"Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 5,

The number as a string for all other cases.

**Input:** A number as an integer.

**Output:** The answer as a string.

**Example:**

fizz_buzz(15) == "Fizz Buzz"
fizz_buzz(6) == "Fizz"
fizz_buzz(5) == "Buzz"
fizz_buzz(7) == "7"

**Precondition:**

0 < number â‰¤ 1000
